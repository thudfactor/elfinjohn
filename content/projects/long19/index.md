This project for the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University is intended to serve as a clearinghouse for digitized collections of artifacts and literature related to the struggle to achieve and maintain women’s access to the vote. [Here is a press release about the project](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/news/in-news/mellon-foundation-grant-radcliffes-schlesinger-library).

### Built With

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in place of a traditional CMS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the collections interface
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the collections database
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for server-side mediation between the React application and Mongo DB.
- [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) for design implementation.

In addition to these tool sets, the project has so far involved training the client to use Markdown and Gitlab's Web IDE, as well as importing diverse data sets from CSV files and several standardized academic archival data systems like the [Digital Public Library of America's Metadata Application Profile](https://pro.dp.la/hubs/metadata-application-profile) and the [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html).

It's been exciting and interesting to build a web site with the Schlesinger Library that is so tightly focused on one topic.
