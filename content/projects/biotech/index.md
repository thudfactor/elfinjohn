For the past ten years I have often been called upon to do front-end work for a biotech company. Unfortunately, this work was done under a very strict NDA, so I am unable to provide screenshots or discuss the work in detail, but all of the projects were scientific visualization with data interactivity.

  This is a generic laboratory scene and probably has nothing to do with activities that happened as a result of the software I was writing.

The earliest versions were build using Flex, ActionScript's development environment for the Flash player, and the Maté framework. Once Flash lost its charm, a new — and far more interactive — version of the product was created using Angular and D3js. Several years later the project was re-implemented in React with a speedier D3js implementation. 

Although I didn’t get much to show others from this project, I did get to write a [small tutorial](https://gist.github.com/thudfactor/6611441) about dragging-and-dropping on SVG, and my experience with D3 led to a three-hour workshop I conducted for [HighEdWeb in Buffalo](http://2013.highedweb.org/EventDetail.aspx?guid=97c75143-469a-4fb4-a7c4-77ed3b949710) and Fluent 2014 in San Francisco.
