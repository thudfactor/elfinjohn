description: A 1911 pamphlet (which is the 20th century way of saying “blog post”) about the rights of women compared to the others the government deems unfit to participate in democratic action.

Before there were blogs, there were pamphlets. This one shows its age in it’s determined use of dialect and less-than-sensitive language about people with mental illness and developmental disorders, but other than that it’s surprising how much it resembles the stuff that gets screen-shotted and circulated on Facebook and Twitter.

I found this while working on a client project. The original scan of the pamphlet is available [at the Claremont Colleges Digital Library](http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15831coll5/id/1342/rec/1) but they didn't have a transcription into actual text. So I've added that here.

## A Allegory on Wimmen’s Rights
*By Josiah Allen’s Wife*

“Wimmen haint no business with the laws of the country,” said Josiah.

“If they haint no business with the law, the law haint no business with them,” said I warmly. “Of the three classes that haint no business with the law—lunatics, idiots, and wimmen—the lunatics and idiots have the best time of it,” says I, with a great rus of ideas into my brain that almost lifted up the border of my head-dress. “Let a idiot kill a man; ‘What of it?’ says the law. Let a luny steal a sheep; again the law murmurs in a calm and gentle tone, ‘What of it? They haint no business with the law, and the law haint no business with them.’

“But let one of a third class, let a woman steal a sheep, does the law soothe her in those comfortin’ tones? No; it thunders to her in awful accents: ‘Yu haint no business with the law, but the law has a good deal of business with you, vile female; start for state’s prison! You haint nothin’ at all to do with the law, only to pay all the taxes it tells you to, embrace a license bill that is ruinin’ to your husband, give up your innocent little children to a wicket father if it tells you to, and a few other little things, such as bein’ dragged off to prison by it, chained up for life, and hung, and et cetery.’

“‘Methought I once heard the words,’ sithes the female, ‘True government consists in the consent of the governed. Did I dream them, or did the voice of a luny pour them into my ear?’

“‘Haint I told you,’ frowns the law on her, ‘that that don't mean wimmen? Have I got to explain again to your weakened female comprehension, the great fundymental truth that wimmen haint included and mingled in the law books and statutes of the country, only in a condemnin’ and punishin’ sense as it were?’

“‘Alas!’ siths the woman to herself, ‘would that I had the sweet rights of my wild and foolish companions, the idiots and the lunys!’

“‘But,’ says she, ‘are the laws always just, that I should obey them thus implicitly?’

“‘Idiots! lunatics! and wimmen! Are they goin’ to speak?’ thunders tha law. ‘Can I believe my noble right ear? Can I, bein’ blindfolded, trust my seventeen senses? I’ll have you understand that it haint no woman’s business whether the laws are just or unjust; all you have got to do is jest to obey ’em, so start off for prison, my young woman.’

“‘But my housework,’ pleads the woman. ‘Woman’s place is home; it is her duty to remain, at all hazards, within its holy and protectin’ precincts. How can I leave its sacred retirement, to moulder in State’s prison?’

“‘Housework!’ and the law fairly yells the words, he is so filled with contempt at the idea. ‘Housework! Jest as if housework is goin’ to stand in the way of the noble administration of the law. I admit the recklessness and immorality of her leavin’ that holy haven long enough to vote; but I guess she can leave her housework long enough to be condemned, and hung, and so forth.’

“‘But I have got a infant,’ says the woman, ‘of tender days. How can I go?’

“‘That is nothin’ to the case,’ says the law in stern tones. ‘The peculiar conditions of motherhood only unfits a female woman from riding to town in a covered carriage once a year, and layin’ her vote on a pole. I’ll have you understand it’s no hindrance to her at all in a cold and naked cell, or in a public courtroom crowded with men.’

“As the young woman totters along to prison, is it any wonder that she sithes to herself,—

“‘Would that I were an idiot! Alas, is it not possible that I may become even now a luny? Then I should be respected!’”
