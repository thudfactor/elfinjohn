A friend of mine has been listening to [albums off of this list](https://www.listchallenges.com/1001-albums-you-must-hear-before-you-die-editions) and posting about them on Facebook, which inspires me to do the same thing here. I'll be posting listening notes.

The first one I chose was Louis Prima's “The Wildest” from 1956. It’s hard to believe I never heard this album. A few standout tracks -- I've linked them here from YouTube but the audio quality will be a lot better if you can find it on [Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-wildest/725786218), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/4icS85G6VGPbFlB9UGPxct), or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/m/Bsoxnrl6kjdhiqibdnwqf7khjca?t=The_Wildest_-_Louis_Prima).

* [Just a Gigolo / I Ain’t Got Nobody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkrb4h4weW4): David Lee Roth basically _recreated_ this performance in the mid 80s. I like this one better because the backing band is about twenty times more awesome.
* [The Lip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQKz2Giaj7Y): Prima and his (fourth) wife Keely Smith. Smith had a great career in her own right.
* [Banana Split for my Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3fIpilYk6o): I am desperate to learn how to play this song on my ukulele.

I didn't think I knew Prima, but his voice sounded awfully familiar. At first I chalked it up to him sounding like a blend between Louis Armstrong and Frank Sinatra, but no, that wasn't it. He sounds familiar because Louis Prima was King Louis in Disney’s _The Jungle Book_.

This has rapidly become one of my favorite albums; definitely check it out.
